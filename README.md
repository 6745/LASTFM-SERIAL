# LASTFM-SERIAL

Sends the song currently playing from LAST.FM's API over comport

Ensure you add your username and api key in the api request and change the comport and buad to something you are using.

Works great using FC16_HW dot matrix and Parola's Scrolling Example and ardunio! (modify the buffer to something bigger for long titled songs)
