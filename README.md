# LASTFM-SERIAL

Sends the song currently playing from LAST.FM's API over comport

Ensure you rename default.config.json to config.json add everything needed 

Works great using FC16_HW dot matrix and Parola's Scrolling Example and ardunio! (modify the buffer to something bigger for long titled songs)
